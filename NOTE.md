# Personal Notes: Why I Created This Repository

As a heavy researcher, I often open many browser tabs with articles and resources I don't have time to read or organize. Over the past two years, this habit has led to a huge backlog of unread URLs. Traditionally, organizing these links required reading them first, which was time-consuming and often impossible given my schedule.

With the advent of AI tools like NotebookLM, I realized that I may no longer need to read everything myself—AI can help summarize and organize information for me. However, to take full advantage of this, I first needed to organize the backlog of URLs I had collected. This project was created to automate the summarization and grouping of those URLs, making it easier to manage and leverage them with modern AI tools.

## Personal Experiments with GitHub Copilot

I also created this repository to test writing all the code using GitHub Copilot in VS Code. I completed the entire codebase in about 2 hours without manually writing any code—most of my time was spent researching libraries and thinking about the design. This project serves as a testament to how AI-assisted coding can accelerate development and experimentation.
